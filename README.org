This repository contains driver for the AEM10900 energy harvester.

#+begin_quote
The AEM10900 is a fully integrated and compact battery charger circuit that extracts DC power from a solar cell to store energy in a rechargeable battery. This compact and ultra- efficient battery charger allows to extend battery lifetime and eliminates the primary energy storage in a large range of wireless application, such as wearable and medical applications and Smart sensors. Thanks to its Maximum Power Point Tracking and its ultra-low power boost converter, the AEM10900 harvests the maximum available input power from a source to charge a storage element, such as a Li-ion battery. The boost converter operates with input voltages in a range from 115 mV to 1.5 V. With its unique cold-start circuit, it can start operating with an input voltage as low as 250 mV and an input power of only 5 Î¼W. The output voltages are in a range of 2.8 V to 4.8 V. -- [[https://e-peas.com/product/aem10900-solar-battery-charger/][e-peas]]

The repository contains:
- The [[file:aem10900.yaml][YAML]] specification of the driver, as used by Reginald to create the struct fields


** YAML Transpile Instruction
The yaml file can be automatically parsed using [[https://github.com/schilkp/reginald][Reginald]], based on branch ~schilkp/rust~, commit ~dc4ff0d~.

*** Rust version
The rust version is built (from within [[file:rust/src/][rust/src/]]) using:
#+begin_src sh
reginald gen -i ../../aem10900.yaml -o registers.rs rs-structs --enum-derive "Debug" --struct-derive "Debug" --enum-derive "PartialEq" --struct-derive "PartialEq"
#+end_src

*** C version
The C version is built (from within [[file:c/][c/]]) using:
#+begin_src sh
reginald gen -i ../aem10900.yaml -o aem10900_reg.h c-funcpack
#+end_src

*** Markdown Datasheet
The [[file:aem10900_reg.md][markdown datasheet]] is build (from within [[file:README.org][/]]) by using:
#+begin_src sh
reginald gen -i ./aem10900.yaml -o aem10900.md md-datasheet
#+end_src

** Rust driver
The rust driver consists of [[file:rust/src/registers.rs][registers.rs]] and [[file:rust/src/lib.rs][lib.rs]]. ~lib.rs~ is not automatically generated, and contains a struct holding all registers of the chip, as well as providing to/from implementations to a byte array of the whole struct.

** C driver
The C driver consists of [[file:c/aem10900_reg.h][aem10900_reg.h]] and [[file:c/aem10900.h][aem10900.h]]. ~aem10900.h~ is not automatically generated, and contains a struct holding all registers of the chip, as well as providing pack/unpack implementations to a byte array of the whole struct.
